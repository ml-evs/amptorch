# *AmpTorch*: Atomistic Machine-learning Package - PyTorch

*AmpTorch* is a PyTorch implementation of the [Atomistic Machine-learning Package](https://amp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (AMP) code that seeks to provide users with improved performance and flexibility as compared to the original code. The implementation does so by benefiting from state-of-the-art machine learning methods and techniques to be optimized in conjunction with high-throughput supercomputers. *AmpTorch* is built on top of [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Skorch](https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
